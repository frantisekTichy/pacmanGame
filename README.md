# Pacman Game
My game project in C using SDL library. The graphical part of the game has few lacks, but the main functional part is working. I hope you enjoy and my project will help you. Comments are in the Czech language, but I can deliver you the English documentation if you wish, just contact me on my mail.


The program can load your own maze for the game from .txt file, coordinates must be written in vectors. This is your first option. Or you can use two default mazes maps that are in the repository. Program record scores of player and then saving them to another .txt file. At the start of the game in the main window, the program shows the best three scores of the player.

Enjoy.
